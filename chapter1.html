        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p id="p1">
            Data communications and networking are changing the way we do business and the way
            we live. Business decisions have to be made ever more quickly, and the decision makers
            require immediate access to accurate information. Why wait a week for that report
            from Germany to arrive by mail when it could appear almost instantaneously through
            computer networks? Businesses today rely on computer networks and internetworks.
            But before we ask how quickly we can get hooked up, we need to know how networks
            operate, what types of technologies are available, and which design best fills which set
            of needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The development of the personal computer brought about tremendous changes for
            business, industry, science, and education. A similar revolution is occurring in data
            communications and networking. Technological advances are making it possible for
            communications links to carry more and faster signals. As a result, services are evolving
            to allow use of this expanded capacity. For example, established telephone services
            such as conference calling, call waiting, voice mail, and caller ID have been extended.
        </p>
        <p>
            Research in data communications and networking has resulted in new technologies.
            One goal is to be able to exchange data such as text, audio, and video from all
            points in the world. We want to access the Internet to download and upload information
            quickly and accurately and at any. <br>
            This chapter addresses four issues: data communications, networks, the Internet,
            and protocols and standards. First we give a broad definition of data communications.
            Then we define networks as a highway on which data can travel. The Internet is discussed
            as a good example of an internetwork (i.e., a network of networks). Finally, we
            discuss different types of protocols, the difference between protocols and standards,
            and the organizations that set those standards.

                <h2>1.1 DATA COMMUNICATIONS</h2>
            </dt>
            <p>
                When we communicate, we are sharing information. This sharing can be local or
                remote. Between individuals, local communication usually occurs face to face, while
                remote communication takes place over distance. The term telecommunication, which includes telephony,
                telegraphy, and television, means communication at a distance (tele
                is Greek for "far").
                The word data refers to information presented in whatever form is agreed upon by
                the parties creating and using the data.
                Data communications are the exchange of data between two devices via some
                form of transmission medium such as a wire cable. For data communications to occur,
                the communicating devices must be part of a communication system made up of a combination
                of hardware (physical equipment) and software (programs) <br>
                The effectiveness of a data communications system depends on four fundamental characteristics: delivery,
                accuracy, timeliness, and jitter. <br>

                1. Delivery. The system must deliver data to the correct destination. Data must be
                received by the intended device or user and only by that device or user. <br>
                2. Accuracy. The system must deliver the data accurately. Data that have been
                altered in transmission and left uncorrected are unusable. <br>
                3. Timeliness. The system must deliver data in a timely manner. Data delivered late are
                useless. In the case of video and audio, timely delivery means delivering data as
                they are produced, in the same order that they are produced, and without significant
                delay. This kind of delivery is called real-time transmission. <br>
                4. Jitter. Jitter refers to the variation in the packet arrival time. It is the uneven delay in
                the delivery of audio or video packets. For example, let us assume that video packets
                are sent every 3D ms. If some of the packets arrive with 3D-ms delay and others with
                4D-ms delay, an uneven quality in the video is the result.

                <h3>COMPONENTS</h3>
                <p>
                    A data communications system has five components (see Figure 1.1). <br>

                    <br>
                    <span>
                        1. Message. The message is the information (data) to be communicated. Popular
                        forms of information include text, numbers, pictures, audio, and video. <br>
                        2. Sender. The sender is the device that sends the data message. It can be a computer,
                        workstation, telephone handset, video camera, and so on. <br>
                        3. Receiver. The receiver is the device that receives the message. It can be a computer,
                        workstation, telephone handset, television, and so on. <br>
                        4. Transmission medium. The transmission medium is the physical path by which
                        a message travels from sender to receiver. Some examples of transmission media
                        include twisted-pair wire, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable, and radio waves. <br>
                        5. Protocol. A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communications. It represents
                        an agreement between the communicating devices. Without a protocol, two
                        devices may be connected but not communicating, just as a person speaking French
                        cannot be understood by a person who speaks only Japanese.

                <h3>DATA REPRESENTATION</h3>
                <div id="datarepresentation">
                    <p>
                        Information today comes in different forms such as text, numbers, images, audio, and video. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Text</strong> In data communications, text is represented as a bit pattern, a sequence
                        of bits (Os or
                        Is). Different sets of bit patterns have been designed to represent text symbols. Each set
                        is called a code, and the process of representing symbols is called coding. Today, the
                        prevalent coding system is called Unicode, which uses 32 bits to represent a symbol or
                        character used in any language in the world. The American Standard Code for Information
                        Interchange (ASCII), developed some decades ago in the United States, now
                        constitutes the first 127 characters in Unicode and is also referred to as Basic Latin.
                        Appendix A includes part of the Unicode. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Numbers</strong>
                        Numbers are also represented by bit patterns. However, a code such as ASCII is not used
                        to represent numbers; the number is directly converted to a binary number to simplify
                        mathematical operations. Appendix B discusses several different numbering systems. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Images</strong>
                        Images are also represented by bit patterns. In its simplest form, an image is composed
                        of a matrix of pixels (picture elements), where each pixel is a small dot. The size of the
                        pixel depends on the resolution. For example, an image can be divided into 1000 pixels
                        or 10,000 pixels. In the second case, there is a better representation of the image (better
                        resolution), but more memory is needed to store the image.
                        After an image is divided into pixels, each pixel is assigned a bit pattern. The size
                        and the value of the pattern depend on the image. For an image made of only blackand-
                        white dots (e.g., a chessboard), a I-bit pattern is enough to represent a pixel.
                        If an image is not made of pure white and pure black pixels, you can increase the
                        size of the bit pattern to include gray scale. For example, to show four levels of gray
                        scale, you can use 2-bit patterns. A black pixel can be represented by 00, a dark gray
                        pixel by 01, a light gray pixel by 10, and a white pixel by 11.
                        There are several methods to represent color images. One method is called RGB,
                        so called because each color is made of a combination of three primary colors: red,
                        green, and blue. The intensity of each color is measured, and a bit pattern is assigned to
                        it. Another method is called YCM, in which a color is made of a combination of three
                        other primary colors: yellow, cyan, and magenta. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Audio</strong>
                        Audio refers to the recording or broadcasting of sound or music. Audio is by nature
                        different from text, numbers, or images. It is continuous, not discrete. Even when we use a
                        microphone to change voice or music to an electric signal, we create a continuous
                        signal. In Chapters 4 and 5, we learn how to change sound or music to a digital or an
                        analog signal. <br>
                        <br><strong>Video</strong> Video refers to the recording or broadcasting of a picture or movie.
                        Video can either be
                        produced as a continuous entity (e.g., by a TV camera), or it can be a combination of
                        images, each a discrete entity, arranged to convey the idea of motion. Again we can
                        change video to a digital or an analog signal. <br>

                <h3>DATA FLOW</h3>
                <div id="dataflow">
                    <p>
                        Communication between two devices can be simplex, half-duplex, or full-duplex.
                        <br>
                        <span><img height="500px" src="./dataflow.jpg"
                                alt="data flow (simplex, half-duplex, full-duplex) "></span> <br>
                        <strong> Simplex</strong>
                        In simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street. Only one
                        of the two devices on a link can transmit; the other can only receive (see Figure 1.2a).
                        Keyboards and traditional monitors are examples of simplex devices. The keyboard
                        can only introduce input; the monitor can only accept output. The simplex mode
                        can use the entire capacity of the channel to send data in one direction. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Half-Duplex</strong>
                        In half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time. :
                        When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa (see Figure 1.2b).
                        The half-duplex mode is like a one-lane road with traffic allowed in both directions.
                        When cars are traveling in one direction, cars going the other way must wait. In a
                        half-duplex transmission, the entire capacity of a channel is taken over by whichever of
                        the two devices is transmitting at the time. Walkie-talkies and CB (citizens band) radios
                        are both half-duplex systems. <br>
                        The half-duplex mode is used in cases where there is no need for communication
                        in both directions at the same time; the entire capacity of the channel can be utilized for
                        each direction. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong> Full-Duplex </strong>
                        In full-duplex mode (also called duplex), both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously
                        (see Figure 1.2c). <br>
                        The full-duplex mode is like a one-lane street with traffic flowing in both directions
                        at the same time. In full-duplex mode, signals going in one direction share the
                        capacity of the link: with signals going in the other direction. This sharing can occur in
                        two ways: Either the link must contain two physically separate transmission paths, one
                        for sending and the other for receiving; or the capacity of the channel is divided
                        between signals traveling in both directions. <br>
                        One common example of full-duplex communication is the telephone network.
                        When two people are communicating by a telephone line, both can talk and listen at the
                        same time. <br>
                        The full-duplex mode is used when communication in both directions is required
                        all the time. The capacity of the channel, however, must be divided between the two
                        directions. <br>
                        <br>

            <p>
                A network is a set of devices (often referred to as nodes) connected by communication
                links. A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending and/or
                receiving data generated by other nodes on the network.

                <h3><strong>DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING</strong></h3>
                <span>
                    Most networks use distributed processing, in which a task is divided among multiple
                    computers. Instead of one single large machine being responsible for all aspects of a
                    process, separate computers (usually a personal computer or workstation) handle a
                    subset.

                <h3><strong>NETWORK CRITERIA</strong></h3>
                <span>A network must be able to meet a certain number of criteria. The most important of
                    these are performance, reliability, and security.</span>

                    <li>
                        <h5>PERFORMANCE</h5>
                        <span>Performance can be measured in many ways, including transit time and response time.
                            Transit time is the amount of time required for a message to travel from one device to
                            another. Response time is the elapsed time between an inquiry and a response. The
                            performance
                            of a network depends on a number of factors, including the number of users,
                            the type of transmission medium, the capabilities of the connected hardware, and the
                            efficiency of the software. <br>
                            Performance is often evaluated by two networking metrics: throughput and delay.
                            We often need more throughput and less delay. However, these two criteria are often
                            contradictory. If we try to send more data to the network, we may increase throughput
                            but we increase the delay because of traffic congestion in the network

                        <span>In addition to accuracy of delivery, network reliability is measured by the frequency of
                            failure, the time it takes a link to recover from a failure, and the network's robustness in
                            a catastrophe.</span>

                            data from damage and development, and implementing policies and procedures for

                <h3><strong>Types Of Connection</strong></h3>
                <span>A network is two or more devices connected through links. A link is a communications
                    pathway that transfers data from one device to another. For visualization purposes, it is
                    simplest to imagine any link as a line drawn between two points. For communication to
                    occur, two devices must be connected in some way to the same link at the same time.
                    There are two possible types of connections: point-to-point and multipoint.</span> <br>

                        <h5><strong>Point-to-Point</strong></h5>
                        <span>A point-to-point connection provides a dedicated link between two
                            devices. The entire capacity of the link is reserved for transmission between those two
                            devices. Most point-to-point connections use an actual length of wire or cable to connect
                            the two ends, but other options, such as microwave or satellite links, are also possible
                            (see Figure 1.3a). When you change television channels by infrared remote control,
                            you are establishing a point-to-point connection between the remote control and the
                            television's control system.</span>

                        <h5><strong>Multipoint</strong></h5><span>A multipoint (also called multidrop) connection is one
                            in which more
                            than two specific devices share a single link (see Figure 1.3b).
                            In a multipoint environment, the capacity of the channel is shared, either spatially
                            or temporally. If several devices can use the link simultaneously, it is a spatially shared
                            connection. If users must take turns, it is a timeshared connection.</span>

                <h3><strong>PHYSICAL TOPOLOGY</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    The term physical topology refers to the way in which a network is laid out physically.:
                    two or more devices connect to a link; two or more links form a topology. The topology
                    of a network is the geometric representation of the relationship of all the links and
                    linking devices (usually called nodes) to one another. There are four basic topologies
                    possible: mesh, star, bus, and ring (see Figure 1.4). <br>
                    <br>

                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Mesh</strong> In a mesh topology, every device has a dedicated point-to-point link to every
                    other device. The term dedicated means that the link carries traffic only between the
                    two devices it connects. To find the number of physical links in a fully connected mesh
                    network with n nodes, we first consider that each node must be connected to every
                    other node. Node 1 must be connected to n - I nodes, node 2 must be connected to n - 1
                    nodes, and finally node n must be connected to n - 1 nodes. We need n(n - 1) physical
                    links. However, if each physical link allows communication in both directions (duplex
                    mode), we can divide the number of links by 2. In other words, we can say that in a
                    mesh topology, we need <br>
